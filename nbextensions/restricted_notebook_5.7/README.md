## Restricted Notebook View

This extension:

- removes all buttons from the menu except for the save button
- removes keybindings to disable moving, creating and copying cells
- replaces editable notebook name with uneditable one

Notes:

- This version hides all buttons from the toolbar and should be used to completely disable the toolbar for Jupyter Notebook <= 5.7
