## Taskmanager

This extension is based on the snippets nbextension [1].

It is supposed to work with nbgrader but also works without it and lets you save presets of tasks and add task presets.

Task presets are saved in the Jupyter Notebook nbextension folder:

```<sys-prefix>/share/jupyter/nbextensions/taskmanager/custom/```

in the file ```custom_tasks.json```.
